// class
//Make component called application that returns a single DOM element.
//Components should be uppercase
//add props param so we can get properties sent by the component rendering this component

//the app wors. but its big. and its no better than if we just copy and pasted it into our html file. It it gets any bigger ,we are in big trouble because we have to manage both jsx and html.
//lets break up the app into components
//1.header
//2.multiple teams
//3.each team has a counter

// Props are immutable. They do not change.
//State is simply a peice of data that DOES change.
// state has:
// 1. an initial value
// 2. (Infinite number of)  changed values

// In the case of the NL East, all gamesback state at 0
// some kind of mutation occurs(namely, someone loses or wins a game)

// In ES5 to use state, react provides a component for us to use.
// It takes an object as a param.
//ANYTIME STATE CHANGES...THE COMPONENT WILL RE-RENDER- THE HEART OF REACT
